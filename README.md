# HelpDash Multiagent Service

MultiAgent Backend is a FastAPIâ€‘based service that exposes two AI agentsâ€”**Support Agent** and **Dashboard Agent**â€”through a versioned REST API.  
It integrates **CrewAI** to coordinate multi-agent workflows, uses **MongoDB Atlas** for structured data persistence, and leverages the **Gemini API** for LLM-powered prompt processing.  
This backend is productionâ€‘ready, configured for **Gunicornâ€¯+â€¯Uvicorn** behind **NGINX**, and secured with **HTTPS via Certbot**.
